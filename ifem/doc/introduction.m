%% Introduction of iFEM
%
% iFEM is a MATLAB software package containing robust, efficient, and
% easy-following codes for the main building blocks of adaptive finite
% element methods on unstructured simplicial grids in both two and three
% dimensions. Besides the simplicity and readability, sparse
% matrixlization, an innovative programming style for MATLAB, is introduced
% to improve the efficiency.
