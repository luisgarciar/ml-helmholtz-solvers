%% Simplicial Complex in Two Dimensions
%
% We dsecribe the data structure of the simplicial complex associated to a
% two dimensional trianglulation give by |node,elem| . The |node| records
% the coordinates of vertices and |elem| is the pointer from local to
% global incices of vertices. See <meshbasicdoc.html Basic mesh data structure>.
%
% A brief summary of ordering and orientation
%
% * edge: asecond ordering, i.e. edge(:,1)<edge(:,2)
%
% * elem: positive ordering or ascend ordering. The default one is positive
% ordering and the asecond ordering is used for edge elements.
%
% * local edge: 
%   consistent orientation [2 3; 3 1; 1 2];
%   asecond orientation    [2 3; 1 3; 1 2]; 
% The default one is the consistent orientation which will be
% counter-clockwise if elem is positive ordered. The asecond orientation is
% used for edge elements.
%
% * elem2edgeSign: records the inconsistency of the edge
%  orientation and the induced orientation.
%
% Local edge is the induced orientation [2 3; 3 1; 1 2].
%  elem2edgeSign(1:NT,1:4) records the elementwise inconsistency of local
%  edge orientation and global edge orientation. It can be obtained from
%  |dofedge|. This is used to correct the consistency of the local basis
%  with the global basis.
%
% Both elem and local edges are ascend ordering. Then elem2edgeSign =
%  [1 -1 1] records the inconsistency of the edge orientation and the
%  induced orientation. This is used to construct differential operators.

% The basic data structure of a mesh consists of node and elem:
node = [0,0; 1,0; 1,1; 0,1];    % nodes
elem = [2,3,1; 4,1,3];          % elements
%%
% In iFEM, |N, NE, NT| represents the muber of vertice, edges, triangles
% respectively.
%
N = size(node,1); NT = size(elem,1); % NE = size(edge,1); 

%%
% The corresponding simplicial complex consists of vertices, edges and
% triangles. We shall discuss the following three issues:
%
% * *Indexing* of simplexes
% * *Ordering* of vertices of simplexes
% * *Orientatoin* of simplexes
%
% The indexing and ordering are related and the ordering and orientation
% are mixed together. However the indexing has nothing to do with the
% orientation. The indexing and ordering are the combinarotry structure,
% i.e. only |elem| is needed, while the orientation also depends on |node|,
% the geometry emembdding of vertices.
%
% For indexing, ordering and orientation, there are always local and global
% version. The relation between the local and global version is the most
% complicated issue.

%% Indexing of Simplexes
%
% The indexing refers to the numbering of simplexes, e.g., which edge is
% numbered as the first one. There are two types of the indexing: local and
% global. Each simplex in the simplicial complex has a unique index which
% is called the global index. In one triangle, the three vertices and three
% edges have their local index from 1:3. 
%
% In the assembling procedure of finite element methods, an element-wise
% matrix using local indexing is first computed and then assembled to get a
% big matrix using global indexing. Thus the pointer from the local
% indexing to the global indexing is indispensible. For bases independent of
% the ordering and orientation, e.g., |P1| and |P2| elements, the pointer
% is sufficient, otherwise, the inconsistency of local ordering/orientation
% and global ordering/orientation should be taken into account.
%
% *Indexing pointers of vertices*
%
% The |NT| by 3 matrix |elem| is indeed the pointer from the local to the
% global indices of vertices of triangles. For example |elem(t,1)=25| means
% the first vertex of the triangle t is the 25-th vertex.
%
% Similiary, the |NE| by 2 matrix |edge| records the pointer from the local
% to the global indices of vertices of edges.
%
% *Local indexing of edges*
%
% The triangle constists of three vertices indexed as [1,2,3]. Each
% triangle contains three edges. There are two indexing schemes for edges.
%
% * Opposite indexing     |locEdge = [2,3; 3,1; 1,2]|
%
% In |locEdge|, the |i-th| edge is opposite to the |i-th| verices and thus
% called _opposite indexing_.
%
% * Lexicogrphic indexing |locEdgel = [1,2; 1,3; 2,3]|
%
% In |locEdgel|, the indexing is induced from the lexicographic ordering of
% the three edges.
%
% For 2-D triangulations, *we shall always chose opposite indexing*. The
% lexicographic indexing is mainly used in the construction of |face2edge|
% of 3-D triangulations; see <sc3doc.html Simplicial Complex in Three
% Dimensions>. Note that the ordering of vertices of each edge will not
% change the indexing. For example, |locEdge = [2,3; 1,3; 1,2]| use the
% same opposite indexing but different ordering. Chosing |[1 3]| or |[3 1]|
% for the second edge will depend on the consideration of orientation and
% ordering.
%
% *Global indexing of edges*
%
% One can easily collect all edges elementwise. The issue is the
% duplication. For example, each interior edge will be counted twice. The
% |unique| funciton is applied such that each edge has a unique global
% index.
%
totalEdge = uint32([elem(:,[2,3]); elem(:,[3,1]); elem(:,[1,2])]);
sortedTotalEdge = sort(totalEdge,2);
[edge,tempvar,je] = unique(sortedTotalEdge,'rows');
NE = size(edge,1); 
%%
% *Edge pointer*
%
% |elem2edge(1:NT,1:3)| records the pointer from the local index to the
% global index of edges. For example, |elem2edge(t,1)| = 10 means the first
% edge of triangle |t| (which is formed by [2 3] vertices of |t|) is the
% |10-th| one in the |edge| array.
%
% Such information is stored in the third output of |unique| function.
%%
elem2edge = uint32(reshape(je,NT,3));
%%
% Note that the pointer |elem2edge| depends on the local indexing of edges
% used in the generation of |totalEdge|. Here the opposite indexing of
% three local edges is used.

%% Ordering of Vertices
%
% We discuss the ordering of vertices of simplexes. Again there are local
% ordering and global ordering. They may not be consistent and a sign array
% is used to record the inconsistency if any.
%
% The local ordering refers to the ordering of local veritces of a simplex.
% The local ordering could be used in the formulation of the local basis
% and thus the ordering does matter.
%
% The global ordering refers to the ordering of the global index of
% vertices of a simplex.
%
% *elem*. The local ordering is always [1,2,3]. Any permutation of three
% veritces of a triangle still represents the same triangle. Such
% freedom provide a room to record more information like:
% 
% * global ordering of vertices
% * orientation of triangles
% * refinement rule
%
% Two types of ordering of |elem| is of particular importance
%
% * Positive ordering
% * Ascend ordering
%
% In the positive ordering, the three vertices are ordered such that the
% signed area, det(v12,v13), is positive. If |elem| is not positive
% ordered, |elem = fixorder(node,elem)| will compute the signed area by
% |simplexvolume(node,elem)| and switch the vertices for triangles with
% negative areas.
%
% For 2-D triangulations, three vertices of a triangle in 2-D is sorted
% counter-cloclwise and the first vertex is chosen as the newest vertex.
% Such ordering enables the efficient implementation of local refinement
% and coarsening in 2-D; see <bisectdoc.html Bisection in Two Dimensions>
% and <coarsendoc.html Coarsening in Two Dimensions>. *Such ordering scheme
% is the default choice and used in most places*.
%
%
% In ascend ordering, the vertices of |elem| is sorted such that
% |elem(t,1)<elem(t,2)<elem(t,3)|. This can be easily achieved by |elem =
% sort(elem,2)|. Howevery, one has to rotate the boundary flag
% accordingly using |sortelem|.
bdFlag = setboundary(node,elem,'Dirichlet');
display('Before rotation'); display(elem); display(bdFlag);

[elem,bdFlag] = sortelem(elem,bdFlag);
display('After rotation'); display(elem); display(bdFlag);

%%
% Ascend ordering will benefit the construction of local bases for high
% order basis or basis with orientation.
%
% We may switch the default positive ordering of |elem| to ascend ordering
% when generating data structure for finite element basis. However such
% sorting is always hidden in the subroutines when a finite element basis
% requiring ordering is generated; see |PoissonRT0| and |PoissonBDM1|.

%%
% *edge*. The global ordering of edges is always ascended, i.e.
edge(:,1) < edge(:,2);
%% 
% Indeed in the generation of |edge|, the |totalEdge| is sorted to the
% ascend ordering such that |unique| can be applied.
%%
%
% Recall that we always use the opposite indexing of edges. We could use
% _ascend ordering_ , i.e.
locEdge = [2 3; 1 3; 1 2]; % Ascend ordering of local edges
%%
% or the _consistent (orientation) ordering_ 
locEdge = [2 3; 3 1; 1 2]; % Consistent ordering of local edges
%%
% It is consistent since the local ordering orientation of edges is
% consistent with the induced orientation of the three edges; see the
% discussion on the orientation.
%
% There might be an inconsistency between the local and global ordering
% (even for the consistent orientation ordering). That is
% |edge(elem2edge(t,1),1)| may not be smaller than
% |edge(elem2edge(t,1),2)|. It will be more clear from the discussion of
% the corresponding orientation.

%% Orientation of Simplexes
% 
% The orientation of a triangle is either positive or negative, the
% orientation of an edge is given by a tangential or normal vector. A
% normal vector is obtained by rotate a given tangential vector by 90
% degree clockwise. For example, when edges are given counter clockwise
% orientation, the corresponding normal vector is the outwards normal
% vector.
%
% The orientation of a d-simplex will induce an orientation of its d-1
% subcomplex and is called _induced orientation_. For example, a positive
% orientated triangle will induce the counter clockwise orientation of its
% three edges.
%
% The ordering of vertices will naturally introduce an orientation and will
% be called _ordering orientation_. More specifically
% 
% * The vector from |edge(:,1)| to |edge(:,2)| defines an orientation of
% edges.
% * The sign of det(v12,v13) defines an orientation of the triangle.
%
% The orientation of a simplex in the simplicial complex should be
% uniquely determined which will be called _global orientation_. It can be
% chosen as the global ordering orientation but not always the case.
%
% Inside one triangle, the local orientation of three edges is more
% involved. The local ordering of edges will introduce a local ordering
% orientation. The orientation of the triangle will also induce an induced
% orientation. The local ordering orientation is used in the computing of
% local bases and the induced orientation is used when computing the
% differential operator locally. They may or may not be consisitent with
% the global orientation of edges.
%
% In general, there will be an inconsistency of the following types of
% orientation and apporipate data structure should be constructured to
% record such inconsistency.
%
% * a global orientation
% * the global ordering orientation
% * the local ordering orientation
% * the local induced orientation
%
% *elem*. The orientation of a triangle is either positive or negative. For
% the global ordering orientation, it is the sign of the signed area
% (output of |simplexvolume|). 
%
[Dlambda,area,elemSign] = gradbasis(node,elem);
%%
% In the output of |gradbasis|, |area| is always positive and an additional
% array |elemSign| is used to record the sign of the signed area.
%
% |Dlambda(t,:,k)| is the gradient of $\lambda_k$. Therefore the outward
% normal direction of the kth face can be obtained by |-Dlambda(t,:,k)|
% which is independent of the ordering and orientation.
%
% *edge*. For 2-D triangulations, *we shall always chose global ordering
% orientation*, i.e., from the lower index to the bigger index. 
%
% The local ordering orientation is implicitly used when computing finite
% element basis in each element. For example, the edge element on edge |[i j]|
% in |locEdge| is defined as
%
% $$\phi_{i,j} = 2(\lambda_i \nabla \lambda_j - \lambda_j \nabla \lambda_i).$$ 
%
% Permutation of |[i j]| to |[j i]| will change the sign of the basis. Note
% that this is locally, i.e., element by element.
%
% The global basis associated to an edge, however, depends only on the
% global orientation of this edge. We introduce |elem2edgeSign(1:NT, 1:3)|
% to record the inconsistency of a local ordering orientation and a global
% orientation.
%
% For the consistent local ordering [2 3; 3 1; 1 2] and global ascend
% ordering orientation, the elem2edgeSign can be generated as follows:

elem2edgeSign = ones(NT,3,'int8');
totalEdge = uint32([elem(:,[2,3]); elem(:,[3,1]); elem(:,[1,2])]);
idx = (totalEdge(:,1)>totalEdge(:,2));
elem2edgeSign(idx) = -1;

%%
% There is one more inconsistency between the induced orientation and the
% global orientation of edges. If a triangle is positive orientated, the
% induced edge orientation should be given by the outwards (relative to a
% triangle) normal vector. This induced orientation may not be consistent
% with the global orientation of edges.
%
% It depends on the ordering of |elem| and |locEdge|. When |elem| is
% positive ordered and |locEdge| is consistently ordered, it is.
%
% For ascend ordering of |elem| and |edge|, we denote the direction as +1
% if the direction of an edge is the same with the induced direction in a
% certain elem, and -1 otherwise. Then the consistency is given by
elem2edgeSign = [+1 -1 +1];

%%
% The second sign is -1 because the local edge in ascend ordering is [1
% 3] not [3 1].
%%
% The |elem2edgeSign| will be used when assembling differential operators.
% For example, when computing |div| operators on a positive orientated
% triangle, the edge should have outwards normal direction or equivalently
% the counter clockwise orientation.
%%
% We summarize the two popular ordering and orientation schemes below.

%% Positive Ordering and Orientation
%
% The vertice of the |eleme| is sorted such that the area is always
% positive. i.e. the three vertices of the elem are ordered
% counter-clockwisely. Furthermore the first vertex is always the newest
% vertex of the triangle for the easy of local mesh refinement and
% coarsening.
%
% The local edge is using opposite indexing and consistent ordering
%
% |locEdge = [2,3; 3,1; 1,2]|
%
% The ascend ordering is used for global edges, i.e., |edge| is sorted s.t.
%
% |edge(:,1) < edge(:,2)|
%
% The inconsistency of the orientation is recorded in|elem2edgeSign|.
%
% *Where to use*: This is the default ordering and orientation scheme. 
%
%% Ascend Ordering and Orientation
%
% *Ascend ordering*. The vertices of |elem| is sorted such that
%
% |elem(t,1)<elem(t,2)<elem(t,3)|
%
% The local edge is also in the ascend ordering
%
% |locEdge = [2,3; 1,3; 1,2]|
%
% The ascend ordering is used for edges, i.e., |edge| is sorted s.t.
%
% |edge(:,1) < edge(:,2)|
%
% It is easy to see the benefit of ascend ordering: the ordering of local
% edges is consistent with the global ones and so is the corresponding
% orientation.
%
% *Orientation*. We choose the ordering orientation.
%
% |elem: sign(det(v12,v13))|
%
% |edge: from the node with smaller global index to bigger one|
% 
% For |edge|, the orientation of the global ordering and the local
% ordering is consistent. But they are not consistent with the induced
% orientation inside one triangle. Such inconsistency is recorded in 
%
% |elem2edgeSign = [+1 -1 +1]|
%
%
% *Where to use*: for H(curl) and H(div) elements and high order (cubic and
% above) H(grad) elements.
