%% Project: Linear Finite Element Methods
%
% The purpose of this project is to write a finite element code for
% solving the Poisson equation in a general polygonal domain using
% piecewise linear finite elements. 

%% Step 1: Download and Install iFEM
%
% * Download <https://bitbucket.org/ifem/ifem/get/tip.zip iFEM>
% * Unzip the file to where you like
% * In MATLAB, go to the iFEM folder  
% * Run |setpath.m|

%% Step 2: Mesh
%
% * Generate mesh for square and disk domains
[node,elem] = squaremesh([0,1,0,1],0.25);
showmesh(node,elem);
%%
[node,elem] = circlemesh(0,0,1,0.2);
showmesh(node,elem);
%%
% * Uniform refine to get a finer mesh
[node,elem] = uniformrefine(node,elem);
showmesh(node,elem);

%% Step 3: Assembling 
%
% Compare three ways of assembling stiffness matrix discussed in <http://math.uci.edu/~chenlong/226/Ch3FEMCode.pdf Programming of FEM>.

%     profile viewer

%%
% Compare the computational time for different N (by uniform refinement of
% the initial mesh).

%% Step 4: Right hand side
%
% Using three points quadrature (i.e. 3 middle points of a triangle) to
% compute the right hand side vector.

%% Step 5: Boundary conditions
%
% * Use |findboundary.m| to get all boundary nodes and edges
% * Code pure Dirichlet boundary condition 
% * Code pure Neumann boundary condition
% * (*optional*) Code pure Robin boundary condition
%        $u + d\nabla u\cdot n = g_R$ on the boundary

%% Step 6: Convergence
%
% * Choose a smooth solution, say $u = \sin(2\pi x)\cos(2\pi y)$, calculate the
% right hand side f and boundary conditions for the unit square. 
% * Use your subroutine to get an approximation and use |showresult| to plot
% the mesh and the solution.
% * Use |uniformrefine.m| to refine the grid and compute a sequence of
% solutions.
% * Compute the error in H1 norm and L2 norm using |getH1error| and
% |getL2error|.
% * Compute the error | ||D u_I - D u_h|| |, where |u_I |  is the nodal
% interpolation, using the stiffness matrix.
% * Use |showrate| to plot the error and the rate of convergence.
%
% Code your subroutine in a general way such that you can solve the Poisson
% equation on a different mesh by changing the input arguments. After you
% get the desireable results for the unit square, try to solve $-\Delta u =
% 1$ with homogenous Neumann boundary conditions on the unit disk. The
% exact solution can be found using the polar coordinate.
